## Amplify! your crystal radio set

![]()

Build this simple two transistor amplifier for your crystal set and pull in the weaker stations. This circuit will operate with almost any type of transistors and will surprisingly still keep functioning when the battery is dis-connected. Since it takes so little power we have not included a switch. When the power is applied, the transistors amplify the signal considerably and you may even be able to drive a small 15ohm or 33ohm speaker if the voltage is increased to 6v.  Almost any crystal set can be used. The only part you need to remove is the crystal itself. Its function is performed by the first transistor. Crystal sets can be roughly divided into two groups. Slug tuned coil types and variably capacitor types. The first has a coil of wire wound on a former in which a ferrite rod is allowed to slide. This rod varies the "Q" of the coil and thus alters the frequency at which the circuit will resonate. This coil is used in conjunction with a fixed capacitor of about 400 - 500pf. Unfortunately the effectiveness of this circuit diminishes as the rod comes out of the coil. This is overcome by having a fixed aerial coil& rod assembly and adjusting the capacitance in the circuit. Open up your crystal set and take a look inside. It will not matter which type you have. They will both work equally well with this high gain amplifier. All the parts will fit inside the crystal-set container without the need of a tag strip. Try to make a neat "birds-nest" soldering job. Good Luck!
